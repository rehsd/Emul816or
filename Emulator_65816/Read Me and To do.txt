To do:
-Only enable interrupts if IER flag is set appropriately. Need general improvements to interrupt support.
-Exception handling
-Lots of safety code
	-When moving mouse out of bounds
	-When typing / printing chars out of bounds


Issues:
-(tentatively RESOLVED): CPX doesn't appear to be setting Carry flag properly. Likely same with CMP and CPX.
-In the middle of raising interrupts. Currently, it's off a bit. I'm likely accidentally writing to unintended registers due to 16-bit.
